| Structural Design Pattern | Description                                                                 | Common Use Cases                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Adapter                   | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.                           | Integrating legacy code, third-party libraries        |
| Bridge                    | Decouples abstraction from implementation so they can vary independently.  | UI toolkits, device drivers                           |
| Composite                 | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. | File systems, GUI components                          |
| Decorator                 | Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.                              | Logging, security, UI enhancements                    |
| Facade                   | Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.                    | API wrappers, simplifying library usage               |
| Flyweight                | Reduces memory usage by sharing common data among similar objects.         | Text rendering, game development                      |
| Proxy                    | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.                    | Lazy loading, access control, remote object handling  |
