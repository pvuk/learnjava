 * how much data your JVM can handle and optimizing memory usage is crucial for building scalable and efficient applications.

	âœ… 1. How to Identify Maximum Records JVM Can Handle
	Thereâ€™s no fixed number of records because it depends on:
	
	. JVM heap size
	. Size of each object (e.g., length of each string)
	. Other memory usage (threads, GC, etc.)
	But you can estimate it by:

		//âœ… 1. How to Identify Maximum Records JVM Can Handle
		long maxHeapSize = Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory(); // in bytes
		System.out.println("Max Heap Size (MB): " + (maxHeapSize / (1024 * 1024)));//This gives you the maximum heap memory allocated to the JVM.

		//âœ… 2. How to Get Current Memory Usage
		Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();
		long usedMemory = runtime.totalMemory() - runtime.freeMemory();
		System.out.println("Used Memory (MB): " + (usedMemory / (1024 * 1024)));//You can run this before and after generating your list to see how much memory it consumes.
		
		/*
		 * âœ… 3. How to Optimize Memory Usage
		 * 
		 * ðŸ”¹ a. Use .limit(n) on streams
			Always limit infinite streams to avoid memory overflow.
			
			ðŸ”¹ b. Use StringBuilder instead of reduce("", String::concat)
			String::concat creates many intermediate strings. StringBuilder is more memory-efficient.
			
		 * ðŸ”¹ c. Tune JVM Heap Settings
			You can increase heap size using JVM options:
			java -Xms512m -Xmx2048m YourApp
			
			. -Xms: initial heap size
			. -Xmx: maximum heap size
		
			ðŸ”¹ d. Profile with Tools
			Use tools like:
			
			. VisualVM
			. JConsole
			. JProfiler
			. YourKit
			These help monitor memory usage, GC activity, and object allocation.
			
		 * âœ… 4. Estimate Record Capacity
			You can estimate how many records fit in memory by:
			
			Measuring memory before and after generating n records.
			Calculating average memory per record.
			Dividing total heap size by average record size.
